### Hi sorry I can't find that file

If there is an extension at the end of the file such as `.pdf` or `.png`, that file probably doesn't
exist, or is in a different place.

If there is no extension `[path]/all`, the config file on the server side is probably incorrect.
Please blame aria for messing up writing config files.
